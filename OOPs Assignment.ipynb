    "In Python, the built-in function open() is used to open a file. The open() function takes two arguments:\n",
    "the name of the file and the mode in which the file is opened. The mode in which a file is opened determines\n",
    "how the file can be manipulated and what operations can be performed on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several modes in which a file can be opened in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read Only): This is the default mode in which the file is opened. When a file is opened in this mode, \n",
    "the file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file, and you can only read the contents of the file.\n",
    "You cannot write to or modify the file in this mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write Only): When a file is opened in write mode, the file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated (i.e., deleted), and you can write new data to the file. \n",
    "If the file does not exist, a new file with the given name will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append Only): When a file is opened in append mode, the file pointer is placed at the end of the file.\n",
    "If the file already exists, you can only write new data to the file, and the existing data will not be modified. \n",
    "If the file does not exist, a new file with the given name will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive Creation): This mode is similar to 'w', but it only opens the file if it does not already exist. \n",
    "If the file exists, the operation will raise an error. \n",
    "This mode is useful for ensuring that the file you are about to write to is not overwritten by another process or user.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary): This mode is used when working with binary files, such as images or audio files. In binary mode,\n",
    "the file is opened in its raw binary format, and the contents of the file are treated as a sequence of bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "'t' (Text): This mode is used when working with text files. In text mode,\n",
    "the contents of the file are treated as text and are encoded as Unicode. \n",
    "This is the default mode if no other mode is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in read mode\n",
    "f = open(\"file.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a file in write mode\n",
